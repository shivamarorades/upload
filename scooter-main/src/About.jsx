            Through these first fleet of models on-hand, we are aiming to reduce up to 90% of the cost of mobility mainly due to the fact that they are powered lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable electrically thus saving a considerable amount of money in paying for fuel by just plugging their electric scooters on a power outlet. We are also aiming to create nationwide visibility and availability. This is our way of spreading cost-effective mobility without actually compromising on quality and efficiency.
